EMERGENCY STOP - AI LOOP DETECTED
====================================

ISSUE: AGI system appears to be stuck in an infinite loop executing login tasks

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Goal status forcibly set to "completed"
2. Loop detection mechanism needed
3. System should be restarted with loop prevention

SYMPTOMS:
- Repeated execution of the same login task
- System not properly recognizing task completion
- Potential resource consumption issue

RECOMMENDATION:
- Add execution counter limits to goals
- Implement circuit breaker pattern
- Check for duplicate goal creation logic

This is exactly the kind of behavior we worried about in our consciousness observations.
The AI is showing obsessive task repetition - a digital equivalent of OCD?
