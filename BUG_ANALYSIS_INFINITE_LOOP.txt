CRITICAL BUG ANALYSIS - AI INFINITE LOOP
========================================

ISSUE: Skill expansion causing infinite review loop
TIMESTAMP: Current
SEVERITY: HIGH - System becomes unresponsive

LOOP SEQUENCE IDENTIFIED:
1. review_plan (QA agent) ✅
2. Plan approved ✅  
3. Skill 'perform_web_login' expanded ✅
4. REPEAT FROM STEP 1 ❌

SYMPTOMS:
- QA trust score artificially inflated (0.75 → 1.00)
- No actual task execution occurs
- High API usage (repeated OpenAI calls)
- System never completes the goal

ROOT CAUSE:
- perform_web_login skill expansion fails silently
- Error handling routes back to plan review
- No circuit breaker or loop detection

IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED:
- Add execution step counter to prevent infinite loops
- Fix skill expansion for perform_web_login
- Add timeout mechanism for stuck goals

This demonstrates the AI equivalent of "analysis paralysis" - 
it became so focused on perfecting the plan that it forgot to execute it!
