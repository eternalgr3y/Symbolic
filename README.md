# SymbolicAGI

SymbolicAGI is an experimental AGI architecture designed to explore concepts of symbolic reasoning, self-improvement, and autonomous goal generation. The system is built on a modular, multi-agent architecture where a central orchestrator manages specialized agents to achieve complex tasks.

## Core Concepts

-   **Meta-Cognitive Loop:** The AGI has a background process (`MetaCognitionUnit`) that reflects on its own performance, generates new goals based on internal drives, and seeks to improve its own capabilities without direct human instruction.
-   **Skill Acquisition & Versioning:** The AGI can learn new multi-step skills from successfully executed plans. These skills are versioned to prevent regressions, and the system can autonomously review and improve them over time.
-   **Generative Skill Synthesis:** The AGI can create entirely new skills from a high-level description of a desired workflow, which are then validated for safety before being saved.
-   **Interactive Web Navigation:** A specialized `Browser` agent, powered by Playwright, allows the AGI to interact with modern websites by clicking buttons, filling forms, and reading content.
-   **Ethical Governance:** All plans generated by the AGI are reviewed by an `EthicalEvaluator` against a core set of values to ensure actions are safe and aligned.
-   **Self-Mutation:** The AGI analyzes its own failures and generates permanent "reasoning mutations"â€”rules that are added to its core planning prompt to prevent it from making the same class of error in the future.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10+
-   An OpenAI API key

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd symbolic-agi
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies in editable mode:** This command installs all required packages from `pyproject.toml`, including development tools.
    ```bash
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```

5.  **Install Playwright browser binaries:** This is a one-time setup to download the browsers that Playwright will control.
    ```bash
    python -m playwright install
    ```

### Running the AGI

To run the AGI in its interactive, autonomous mode, execute the following command from the project root:

```bash
python -m symbolic_agi.run_agi

The AGI will start, and you can provide it with high-level goals. If left idle, it will begin to generate its own goals based on its internal drives.

Running Checks
To ensure code quality, you can run the same checks used in our development process:

Linter (Ruff):
ruff check symbolic_agi

Type Checker (MyPy):
mypy symbolic_agi
