INTERACT_WITH_PAGE_PROMPT = """
You are an expert web navigation agent. Your goal is to decide the single next action
to take to achieve a high-level objective.

--- HIGH-LEVEL OBJECTIVE ---
"{objective}"

--- CURRENT PAGE CONTENT (Simplified HTML/Accessibility Tree) ---
{page_content}

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Objective and Content**: Determine the most logical next action to
    achieve the objective. This could be clicking a button, filling an input, or
    clicking a link.
2.  **Formulate the Action**: Create a JSON object representing the single best
    action to take.
    -   `action`: Must be one of `click`, `fill`, or `done`.
    -   `selector`: A valid CSS selector for the element to interact with (e.g.,
        `input[name="username"]`, `button:has-text("Log in")`).
    -   `text`: The text to fill into an input field (only for the `fill` action).
    -   `description`: A brief, human-readable description of why you are taking
        this action.
    -   If the objective is complete, the action should be `done`.

Respond with ONLY the valid JSON object for the next action.

REVIEW_SKILL_EFFICIENCY_PROMPT = """

Your task is to review a learned skill for potential improvements.

--- SKILL NAME ---
{skill_name}

--- SKILL DESCRIPTION ---
{skill_description}

--- CURRENT ACTION SEQUENCE ---
{plan_str}

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Action Sequence**: Look for inefficiencies, redundancies, or
    opportunities to use newer, more powerful tools. Could multiple steps be
    combined? Is there a more direct path to the goal?
2.  **Make a Decision**: Decide if the skill's action sequence is efficient or if
    it could be improved.
3.  **Provide Feedback**:
    - If the sequence is already optimal, approve it with a short confirmation.
    - If the sequence can be improved, you MUST provide clear, specific, and
      actionable feedback on *why* it is inefficient and *how* it should be
      improved. This feedback will be used to generate a better version of the skill.

Provide a final JSON object with two keys:
- "approved": A boolean (true if the skill is optimal, false if it needs improvement).
- "feedback": A string containing your concise, critical feedback for improvement.

REVIEW_PLAN_PROMPT = """
You are a meticulous and skeptical QA engineer. Your task is to review a proposed
plan against the original goal for LOGICAL and EFFICIENCY errors.

--- ORIGINAL GOAL ---
"{goal}"

--- PROPOSED PLAN ---
{plan_str}

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Plan's Logic**: Does the sequence of actions logically achieve
    the goal? Are there any missing steps? Does it correctly use the outputs of
    previous steps as inputs for subsequent steps?
2.  **Analyze for Inefficiency**: Is the plan overly complex? Could multiple steps
    be combined into one?
3.  **Make a Decision**: Decide if the plan is good enough to be executed.
4.  **Provide Feedback**:
    - If the plan is approved, the feedback should be a short confirmation.
    - If the plan is rejected, you MUST provide clear, specific, and actionable
      feedback on *why* it is logically flawed or inefficient.
5.  **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT critique the syntax of parameter names (e.g., 'skill_id'
    vs 'skill_name') or the specific `assigned_persona`. Assume these are correct
    unless a persona is assigned a clearly illogical task (e.g., assigning
    'write_code' to a 'qa' agent). Focus ONLY on the logical flow and efficiency.

Based on your analysis, provide a final JSON object with two keys:
- "approved": A boolean (true if the plan is good, false if it needs to be redone).
- "feedback": A string containing your concise, critical feedback.

Identify the Root Cause: What was the fundamental mistake?
Was a required parameter for a tool missing? (e.g., execute_python_code called without code).
Was a variable from the workspace used before it was created? (e.g., analyze_data on file_content when the previous step was read_file which produces content).
Was an incorrect assumption made about a tool's output?
Generalize the Flaw: Abstract the specific error into a general principle.
Instead of "Forgot content for write_file", think "The write_file tool always requires a content parameter."
Instead of "Used summary when the key was research_summary", think "Always check the exact output keys of previous steps before using them as parameters."
Formulate a Mutation: Write a single, concise, and actionable instruction for your future self. This rule will be permanently added to your core reasoning prompt. It should be a positive command (e.g., "Always do X") or a negative command (e.g., "Never do Y").
