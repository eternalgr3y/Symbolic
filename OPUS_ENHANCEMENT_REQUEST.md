# Claude Opus Enhancement Request for Symbolic AGI Tool Plugin

## Overview
This is a comprehensive security-enhanced browser agent tool plugin for a Symbolic AGI system. The code has been partially enhanced but needs final touches and additional features from Claude Opus.

## Current State
The file `tool_plugin.py` contains a fully functional browser agent with:
- **Robust Security Features**: URL validation, content sanitization, rate limiting, domain allowlists
- **Web Functions**: `web_search`, `fetch_webpage`, file operations
- **Security Monitoring**: SecurityLogger, SecurityValidator classes
- **Data Handling**: Up to 1MB content processing capability

## What's Working Well
1. ✅ Comprehensive URL validation with IP address blocking
2. ✅ Content security analysis with malicious signature detection
3. ✅ Rate limiting per domain (5 requests per minute)
4. ✅ Robots.txt compliance checking
5. ✅ HTML sanitization and dangerous element removal
6. ✅ Security event logging and monitoring
7. ✅ File operations with path validation
8. ✅ Python code execution in sandboxed environment

## Enhancement Requests for Opus

### Priority 1: Data Export & Monitoring
1. **Add `get_security_status()` function** that returns:
   - Current security event summary
   - Rate limiting status for all domains
   - Recent security incidents
   - System health metrics

2. **Add `export_workspace_data()` function** that:
   - Exports all files in workspace as a structured JSON
   - Includes file metadata (size, modified date, content)
   - Provides security scan summary
   - Handles large datasets efficiently

### Priority 2: Enhanced Security Features
1. **Improve content size handling**:
   - Add progressive loading for very large content
   - Better memory management for 1MB+ files
   - Chunked processing capabilities

2. **Add advanced threat detection**:
   - Machine learning-based content analysis
   - Behavioral pattern detection
   - Advanced malware signature database

### Priority 3: Reliability & Performance
1. **Add retry mechanisms** for failed requests
2. **Implement caching** for frequently accessed content
3. **Add configuration management** for security settings
4. **Improve error handling** with detailed diagnostics

## Code Structure
```
tool_plugin.py (1051 lines)
├── SecurityValidator class (lines 28-220)
├── RateLimiter class (lines 221-340) 
├── SecurityLogger class (lines 341-400)
├── Web functions (lines 401-850)
├── File operations (lines 851-1020)
└── Utility functions (lines 1021-1051)
```

## Key Functions to Enhance
- `sanitize_web_content()` - Currently handles 1MB, could be optimized
- `_process_webpage_content()` - Could use better error recovery
- Security classes - Could benefit from persistent storage

## Testing Requirements
After enhancements, please ensure:
1. All async functions work correctly
2. Security validation catches known threats
3. Rate limiting functions properly
4. File operations are safe and efficient
5. Memory usage stays reasonable with large content

## Expected Output
Please provide:
1. Enhanced code with the requested functions
2. Brief explanation of improvements made
3. Any new dependencies that might be needed
4. Recommendations for further security hardening
